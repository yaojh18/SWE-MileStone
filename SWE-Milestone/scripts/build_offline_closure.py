    """Multi-stage Dockerfile that vendors the UNION of every milestone's Cargo
    workspace into /opt/vendor, then bakes a $CARGO_HOME offline redirect.

    `cargo vendor` needs a cwd with a workspace manifest, so the FIRST milestone
    testbed (/tb/m0) is the cwd and the REST (m1..mN) are passed as `--sync`
    targets — one invocation (a loop would clobber the vendor dir each call). The
    base image's OWN /testbed/Cargo.toml (the A-baseline this stage is FROM) is also
    --sync'd, so the vendor spans A→B: with `--versioned-dirs` the result holds BOTH
    the A and B version of every crate (e.g. bstr-1.10.0 AND bstr-1.12.0). This is
    REQUIRED because the agent starts from the A-baseline /testbed and the
    $CARGO_HOME redirect points ALL crates.io at /opt/vendor — a B-only vendor would
    fail the agent's first `cargo build` (`failed to select a version`).
    Path-deps (the repo's own workspace crates) carry no `source` line and are
    auto-excluded by cargo vendor, so the answer is never baked in.

    The config is written to $CARGO_HOME (/usr/local/cargo/config.toml), NEVER to
    /testbed/.cargo — the agent's `git clean -xfd` would wipe the latter and the
    offline redirect would silently vanish.

    Optional `toolchain={"rust": "1.88.0", ...}`: when a rust version is given, the
    FINAL stage installs it ONLINE at build time
    (`rustup toolchain install <v> --profile minimal && rustup default <v>`).
    nushell's milestones pin `channel="1.88.0"` in rust-toolchain.toml, but the
    base/milestone images only ship 1.86 — the 1.88 toolchain CANNOT be COPY'd from
    a milestone (none carries it) and must be fetched from static.rust-lang.org
    during the (online) build. rustup's source is NOT an answer registry, so this
    is safe and necessary. `rustup default` makes cargo use 1.88 for any path
    outside /testbed too (rust-toolchain.toml only overrides inside the workspace).
    `--profile minimal` is sufficient: `cargo build` needs only rustc + rust-std +
    cargo, all of which minimal provides, so the milestone's `profile="default"`
    directive triggers no extra (offline-failing) component download at gate time.
    Repos with no toolchain key (ripgrep) emit no rust-install line — unchanged.

    Optional `extra_vendor_crates`: a list of TOML dependency spec strings (e.g.
    ["arbitrary = \\"=1.4.2\\"", "derive_arbitrary = \\"=1.4.2\\""]).  When present, a
    synthetic workspace `/tmp/extra_vendor/Cargo.toml` is created BEFORE the
    `cargo vendor` step and included as an extra `--sync` target.  This pulls the
    pinned crates into /opt/vendor even if no milestone testbed declares them yet
    (use case: an SRS task asks the agent to ADD a new dependency, so the current
    testbed src doesn't reference it, but the golden Cargo.lock already pins the
    version the agent will need at eval time).  The synthetic workspace is a
    plain package (not a workspace root) so it gets its own fresh Cargo.lock
    resolved from the live registry — the exact version spec in each entry (e.g.
    `= "=1.4.2"`) ensures cargo resolves to exactly that pinned version.

    """Cargo closure via the RAW-CACHE + ONLINE-WARM pattern (NOT `cargo vendor`).

    Why not vendor: nushell pins `reedline` from BOTH crates.io AND a git branch,
    and one milestone (g04_1ddae02) carries the git checkout published as the SAME
    `version = 0.41.0` as the registry crate. `cargo vendor` lays every crate into a
    single `<name>[-<ver>]/` dir keyed by name (+version) and CANNOT hold two
    same-name+version crates from different sources — it aborts the union with
    `found duplicate version of package reedline v0.41.0 vendored from two sources`
    (confirmed empirically WITH and WITHOUT `--versioned-dirs`). The raw cargo cache
    has no such conflict: registry crates live under `registry/{cache,index,src}/`
    keyed by source-hash, and git deps live in a SEPARATE tree `git/{db,checkouts}/`
    keyed by repo-hash — so registry-0.41.0 and git-0.41.0 coexist by construction.

    Mechanism (mirrors go/maven/npm's "online-warm the union", adapted for cargo):
      fetch_builder  FROM <repo>/base:latest
        - The base image's `$CARGO_HOME` (/usr/local/cargo) is ALREADY warm with the
          A-baseline's registry crates, and its /testbed IS the A-baseline workspace
          (Cargo.lock pins the OLD versions). So the union STARTS from A — no extra
          COPY needed for the A side (mirrors go/maven/npm ADDing milestone caches on
          top of the base cache; only the old `cargo vendor` REPLACED via a redirect).
        - Install EVERY pinned rust toolchain ONLINE first (the milestones are
          heterogeneous: 1.86/1.87/1.88; `cargo fetch` inside a workspace honours its
          rust-toolchain.toml, so each channel must exist or rustup would try to
          auto-install mid-fetch).
        - COPY each milestone's FULL /testbed (cargo fetch reads the whole workspace
          + its Cargo.lock; the git revs are pinned in the lock) and run plain
          `cargo fetch` (NO --locked) per milestone INTO the shared `$CARGO_HOME`.
          Each fetch ADDs that milestone's registry crates AND any git checkouts
          (e.g. reedline @ branch=main) to the cache. `cargo fetch` for the base's
          OWN /testbed warms the A side too. --locked is NOT used: nushell's milestone
          locks are mid-migration checkpoints that don't match Cargo.toml (8/13 fail
          `cargo fetch --locked`), so the online fetch re-resolves+warms a superset;
          the offline gate's plain `cargo build --offline` re-resolves identically.
      final          FROM <repo>/base:latest
        - COPY the warmed `$CARGO_HOME` forward (registry cache/index/src + git
          db/checkouts). NO `$CARGO_HOME/config.toml` redirect — unlike vendor this
          path keeps the real registry index, so `cargo build --offline` resolves
          from the cache natively (the hand-built reference image proves a redirect
          is neither present nor needed here).
        - Install the rust toolchain ONLINE + `rustup default <ver>` so cargo uses it
          for any path outside /testbed too (rust-toolchain.toml only overrides
          inside the workspace; the B milestones pin 1.88, the A-baseline pins 1.86 —
          both channels end up present: 1.86 ships in the base, 1.88 is installed).

    Self-exclusion: the repo's OWN nu-* workspace crates are PATH deps (under
    /testbed/crates/*) — `cargo fetch` never downloads them into registry/cache or
    git/, so the cache cannot leak nu-*-0.10[6-9] / nushell-* @ B (verified: only
    legitimate third-party `nu-ansi-term` etc. appear). The generic forbid-glob audit
    stays as defense-in-depth.

    `static.rust-lang.org` (rustup's source) and crates.io/the git host are reachable
    at build time but the closure is SEALED offline at eval; warming from them is
    safe (they are not the answer — the answer is the repo's own B source, which is a
    path dep and never fetched).

    The milestone's own `/testbed` (the B-source) must be injected — NOT the
    A-baseline baked into the staging image. We materialise it on the host via an
    ephemeral `docker create`/`cp`/`rm`, bind-mount it over `/testbed`, and run
    `cd /testbed && <offline_build>` with `--network none`.

    For go ecosystems, pass `goproxy_off=True` to also set `-e GOPROXY=off` in the
    docker run. Without GOPROXY=off, a genuinely-missing module yields a network
    error prefixed `go: <module>@v: dial tcp ...` that escapes the classifier's
    `^<module@version>:` pattern (fail-OPEN). With GOPROXY=off, missing modules
    deterministically produce `module lookup disabled by GOPROXY=off`, which is a
    recognized closure-gap token.

    `classifier` is the `(staging_tag, output) -> (kind, detail)` callable used to
    label a non-zero build as "closure_gap" (BLOCK) vs "source_state" (record, do

    strings and would fail-OPEN on a real maven dependency gap).

    Outcome:

    union of the build-warmed caches). The per-milestone `go build ./...` gate passes
    WITHOUT them precisely because building doesn't need them — but an agent running
    `go test ./...`, `go mod download`, or `go mod verify` WILL (same class as the
    maven-bcprov / npm-caniuse-lite / go-zip gaps). The raw-cache union can only carry
    what some milestone's build happened to cache; it cannot supply a
    declared-but-uncompiled module.

    Fix: a `go_fetch` stage (FROM <repo>/base:latest, so the base image's EXISTING
    A-version cache is the starting point — the union therefore spans A→B) COPYs ONLY
    each milestone's go.mod+go.sum and runs `go mod download all` (the FULL module
    graph — incl. indirect + test deps, NOT the build-scoped subset) per milestone,
    all warming the SAME shared module cache. The toolchain is clean-replaced to the
    repo's go (1.21.13) FIRST so the download resolves under the right go. The final
    stage COPYs the raw-cache union (belt-and-suspenders; it also pins the exact
    A-version bytes already shipped in base) AND the online-fetched graph (the
    superset) into the module cache, then clean-replaces the toolchain. `go mod
    download` only pulls the DEPENDENCIES named in go.mod — never the MAIN module — so
    the cache cannot leak github.com/zeromicro/*; the self-exclusion audit stays clean
    by construction.

    `online_fetch=False` falls back to the legacy raw-cache-union-only assembly (the
    `go_mechanism: raw-cache` config escape) for parity/debugging — but the DEFAULT
    online-fetch path is what closes the declared-but-uncompiled gap.

    Toolchain (unchanged): go-zero's B-source declares `go 1.21` but base ships
    go1.19.13. The target (1.21.13) is baked in the B-milestone images at
    /usr/local/go, so the final stage does `RUN rm -rf /usr/local/go` BEFORE
    `COPY --from=<verified milestone> /usr/local/go /usr/local/go` + `ENV
    GOTOOLCHAIN=local`. The `rm -rf` MUST precede the COPY: an overlay mixes
    go1.19+go1.21 stdlib and `go build` fails (`m0 redeclared`). GOTOOLCHAIN=local
    forbids an auto-toolchain fetch from proxy.golang.org under --network none.

    No `.info`-sidecar synthesis: the build-scoped gate (`go build -mod=mod ./...`)
    resolves straight from the cache.

    prefix), warming `m2_repo` from the reactor rooted at `testbed_dir`.

    The fetch runs TWO maven goals against the milestone's FULL multi-module
    reactor (dubbo is multi-module; `mvn` needs every module's pom to build the
    reactor model), both writing into the SHARED `-Dmaven.repo.local=<m2_repo>`:

      1. `dependency:go-offline` — a cheap broad first pass that resolves the
         compile+runtime dependency graph AND the build/reporting PLUGINS,
         downloading them (and their poms) into the local repo. It is RESOLUTION-ONLY
         (never compiles), so it can't be tripped by a mid-migration source state,
         but it has TWO known limitations: it does not pull TEST-scope-only deps, and
         for version-managed/ranged deps it can resolve a DIFFERENT (often older)
         version than the build actually uses, and may fetch only the `.pom` (not the
         `.jar`). So it is necessary (plugins!) but NOT sufficient.
      2. `test-compile` (ONLINE) on the SAME reactor — THE workhorse. The
         per-milestone offline GATE is `mvn -o test-compile` on this very testbed, so
         running `test-compile` ONLINE here downloads EXACTLY the artifacts (right
         versions, the `.jar` not just the `.pom`, INCLUDING all test-scope deps)
         that the offline gate will later demand — the tightest possible match.
         `go-offline`/`dependency:resolve` proved insufficient: for m006's reactor
         `go-offline` fetched only the bcprov-ext-jdk18on POM (no jar), and for
         m001.1's dubbo-cluster it resolved opentelemetry-sdk-testing 1.49.0 while
         test-compile needs 1.50.0 — only the online `test-compile` pulls the correct
         jar+version. `-fae` (fail-at-end) makes the reactor keep building (and thus
         keep DOWNLOADING each module's deps) past a module whose mid-migration
         source won't compile, so one un-buildable module never starves the rest of
         the cache; `-DskipTests` skips test EXECUTION (we only need test-SOURCES
         compiled, which still resolves+downloads the test-scope deps).

    Both goals are `-o`-free (this is the ONLINE build stage — repo1.maven.org /
    Maven Central is a non-answer registry that serves third-party artifacts, safe to
    fetch from at BUILD time; the closure is sealed offline at eval). Each goal is
    `|| true`-guarded so a milestone whose reactor can't fully build (a mid-migration
    source-state checkpoint, a JDK-gated module) still contributes every dep it COULD
    download to the shared cache, and one milestone's source state never aborts the
    whole multi-milestone fetch. The lint plugins are skipped (see
    `_MVN_FETCH_LINT_SKIPS`) so a spotless/rat format violation can't abort the
    reactor before resolution. `-q` keeps the log readable.

    Note the online `test-compile`/`go-offline` may itself pull the reactor's OWN
    3.3.6 artifacts (from Central, or install reactor modules) into the shared repo —
    the self@B rm in the final stage (run AFTER all fetches) deletes them, so the
    published closure never serves the answer.

    milestone's *declared* deps into the yarn cache, then bake it — the robust
    pattern pip (`pip download` the union freeze) and cargo (`cargo vendor` the
    union of locks) already use, now for npm.

    Why not raw-COPY the milestone caches (the old npm branch)?  Build-warmed yarn
    caches are INCOMPLETE: a dep can be pinned by a milestone's `yarn.lock` yet
    never land in that image's cache (element-web: `caniuse-lite@1.0.30001701` is
    pinned by 4 milestones' lockfile but is in NO milestone's cache — the union of
    the raw caches held only 30001699 + 30001704). So `yarn install --offline
    --frozen-lockfile` fails at those milestones (same class as maven-bcprov /
    go-zip — the milestone caches don't contain every lockfile-declared dep).

    Fix: a `fetch_builder` stage (FROM <repo>/base:latest, so the base image's
    EXISTING A-version yarn cache is the starting point — the union therefore spans
    A→B) COPYs ONLY `package.json` + `yarn.lock` from each milestone into `/m<i>/`
    (just the manifests, NOT the whole /testbed — keeps the build context small and
    pulls no source), then runs one `yarn install` per milestone, all warming the
    SAME shared cache. Each install ADDs that milestone's declared deps (incl.
    caniuse-lite@1.0.30001701) to the shared cache. registry.yarnpkg.com is a
    non-answer registry (it serves third-party npm packages, not element-web's own
    app — which is not published to npm), so fetching from it at BUILD time is
    safe; the closure is sealed offline at eval. The `final` stage (same base)
    COPYs the warmed cache (`yarn_cache`, the versioned dir) back over its own.

    THE --cache-folder GOTCHA (yarn-classic): `--cache-folder X` does NOT make yarn
    write into X — yarn APPENDS its own cache-version segment (`/v6` for yarn 1.22)
    and writes into `X/v6`. The base/milestone images' real cache is
    `/usr/local/share/.cache/yarn/v6` (that trailing `v6` IS yarn's segment;
    `yarn cache dir` reports exactly this), so to warm THAT dir the cache-folder
    must be its PARENT — `/usr/local/share/.cache/yarn` — and yarn re-appends `/v6`.
    Passing the versioned dir itself (`…/yarn/v6`) writes one level too deep, into
    `…/yarn/v6/v6/`, which the offline gate's `yarn install` (reading
    `…/yarn/v6`) never sees → a fetched-but-invisible cache and a false `Can't make
    a request in offline mode ("…caniuse-lite-1.0.30001701.tgz")` gate failure (the
    first integration run hit exactly this). So `--cache-folder` is the parent of
    `yarn_cache`; the COPY target stays `yarn_cache` (the versioned dir yarn fills).

    Per-milestone install flags:
      - `--cache-folder <parent-of-yarn_cache>` so yarn's appended `/v6` lands on
        the real shared cache (see the GOTCHA above); every milestone writes the
        same dir — that is the whole point, the union accumulates.
      - `--ignore-scripts` skips postinstall: we only need the cache POPULATED with
        tarballs, not a built node_modules (no native builds, much faster, and
        avoids a postinstall that wants tools the manifest-only dir lacks).
      - `--non-interactive` so a prompt can never hang the build.
      - PREFER `--frozen-lockfile` (fetch EXACTLY the lockfile-pinned versions); if
        that errors because the milestone's lockfile is itself mid-change
        (source-state: yarn.lock disagrees with package.json), FALL BACK to a plain
        `yarn install` for the cache-warming — we only want the deps fetched, and a
        non-frozen resolve still populates the cache. The fallback is a shell `||`
        inside the RUN so one milestone's source-state lockfile never aborts the
        whole build. `--frozen-lockfile` first keeps the common (clean) case exact.

    No self@B removal: element-web's app source is not published to npm, so there
    is no self@B tarball the cache could serve (cache_forbid_globs is empty → the
    generic audit stays a clean no-op).

    `global_npm_tools` (optional): a list of `<pkg>[@<version>]` specifiers for
    global npm tools declared by the repo's SRS but installed via
    `npm install -g <tool>` (NOT via yarn, so NOT in the yarn cache). Each tool is
    baked into the final stage with `RUN npm install -g <spec>` ONLINE at image
    build time — the binary is then present in the image without any offline install.
    registry.npmjs.org is a non-answer registry (it serves generic CLI tools, not
    the repo's own source), so this fetch is safe at build time. Example:
    `serve@14.2.5` (a static-file server used by playwright tests in some milestones).

    prefix), warming the npm content-addressable cache `cacache` from the
    package.json + package-lock.json in `testbed_ui_dir`.

    This is the npm (NOT yarn) analogue of `assemble_npm_dockerfile`'s yarn
    install: navidrome's UI uses npm (`/testbed/ui/package-lock.json`,
    `npm ci`), so the warm command is `npm`, not `yarn`. The build-warmed
    `_cacache` shipped in a milestone image is INCOMPLETE the same way yarn's was
    (a lockfile can pin a tarball — caniuse-lite-style — that no milestone's build
    actually fetched into _cacache), so we re-populate it ONLINE from each
    milestone's declared deps. registry.npmjs.org serves third-party packages
    (navidrome's UI package, private name `"ui"`, is unpublished), so the
    build-time fetch is safe; the closure is sealed offline at eval.

    PREFER `npm ci` (installs EXACTLY the lockfile-pinned tree → fetches exactly
    the tarballs the offline gate's `npm ci --offline` will later demand), with:
      - `--cache <cacache>` so the fetched tarballs land in the SHARED cache dir
        (every milestone writes the same dir — the union accumulates). Unlike
        yarn's `--cache-folder` GOTCHA, npm's `--cache` IS the literal cache
        directory (no version segment is appended), so we pass `_cacache`'s PARENT
        — npm itself appends `/_cacache`. The base/milestone real cache is
        `/root/.npm/_cacache`, so `--cache` must be `/root/.npm` and npm
        re-appends `_cacache`. (Passing `_cacache` directly would write into
        `/root/.npm/_cacache/_cacache`, invisible to the offline gate.)
      - `--prefer-offline=false` to force a real registry fetch of anything not
        already cached (we are ONLINE here precisely to fill the gaps a prior
        milestone's cache missed — never silently fall back to a stale cache).
      - `--ignore-scripts` so a postinstall (native build, husky, etc.) that wants
        tools the manifest-only dir lacks can't abort the cache-warming; we only
        need `_cacache` POPULATED with tarballs, not a built node_modules.
      - `--no-audit --no-fund` keep the log readable / avoid extra network calls.
    FALL BACK to `npm install` (same flags) when `npm ci` errors because the
    milestone's lockfile is itself mid-change (source-state: package-lock.json
    disagrees with package.json — `npm ci` is strict and aborts, but a non-strict
    `npm install` still resolves+fetches the deps into the cache). The fallback is
    a shell `||` inside the RUN so one milestone's source-state lockfile never
    aborts the whole multi-milestone fetch.

    """DUAL go+npm closure Dockerfile (navidrome): ONE staging image carrying BOTH
    a complete go closure AND a complete npm closure.

    navidrome is a dual-ecosystem repo — a Go backend plus an npm-managed React UI
    (`/testbed/ui`). Neither single-ecosystem assembly suffices alone, so this
    composes the two PROVEN mechanisms into one multi-stage build:

    GO part (identical to `assemble_go_dockerfile`, validated on go-zero):
      - ONLINE-fetch the UNION of every milestone's DECLARED module graph
        (`go mod download all` per milestone, see `_go_fetch_stage`) into the module
        cache, laid OVER the raw-cache rsync UNION of every milestone's build-warmed
        `/go/pkg/mod/cache/download`. The build-warmed caches hold only the modules
        `go build` COMPILED and MISS indirect-only / test-only deps a go.mod declares
        (the go-zero 17-module gap class); the online fetch closes that. Both span
        A→B because every stage is FROM base:latest (the A-baseline cache is the
        starting point) and ADDs each milestone's (B) modules on top.
      - clean-replace the go toolchain to `target_go` (1.24.5): `RUN rm -rf
        /usr/local/go` BEFORE `COPY --from=<milestone reporting target_go>
        /usr/local/go` + `ENV GOTOOLCHAIN=local`. navidrome's milestones split
        between `go 1.24.4` and `go 1.24.5` go.mod directives (and ship the
        matching toolchain); with GOTOOLCHAIN=local a 1.24.4 toolchain can't build
        a `go 1.24.5` milestone (it would try to fetch 1.24.5 from
        proxy.golang.org → fails offline). 1.24.5 builds BOTH, so we standardise on
        it. `pick_go_toolchain_milestone` finds a milestone that reports it. The
        go_fetch stage clean-replaces to this toolchain FIRST so `go mod download`
        resolves the graph under the right go.

    NPM part (the npm — not yarn — analogue of `assemble_npm_dockerfile`):
      - a `npm_fetch` stage (FROM base:latest, so base's A-version _cacache is the
        starting point) COPYs ONLY each milestone's `ui/package.json` +
        `ui/package-lock.json` (small context, no source) and runs one ONLINE
        `npm ci` (fallback `npm install`) per milestone (see
        `npm_online_fetch_cmd`), all warming the SAME shared `/root/.npm/_cacache`.
        Each fetch ADDs that milestone's declared UI deps to the cache, closing any
        caniuse-lite-style gap the build-warmed milestone _cacache missed.

    FINAL stage (FROM base:latest) COPYs all FOUR closures so both ecosystems land
    in one image:
      1. `COPY --from=builder /staging<go-cache> <go-cache>` — the raw-cache unioned
         go module cache (from the go union's `builder` stage).
      2. `COPY --from=go_fetch <go-cache> <go-cache>` — the online-fetched declared
         module graph (the superset; additive over the raw-cache union).
      3. `RUN rm -rf /usr/local/go` + `COPY --from=<tc> /usr/local/go
         /usr/local/go` + `ENV GOTOOLCHAIN=local` — the clean-replaced go
         toolchain.
      4. `COPY --from=npm_fetch <_cacache> <_cacache>` — the warmed npm cache.

    Stage names are disjoint (`builder`/`final` from the go union vs `go_fetch` vs
    `npm_fetch`), so the COPYs compose without collision. navidrome has NO self@B in
    either cache (the Go self-module github.com/navidrome/* is never in the module
    cache by construction — `go mod download` only pulls dependencies, never the main
    module; the UI package `"ui"` is private/unpublished), so there is NO removal step
    — the generic audit (cache_forbid_globs target the go modcache, which never holds
    the self-module) is a clean no-op.

    Ordering rationale (fail-closed): the npm classifier returns closure_gap ONLY
    on a definitive npm cache-miss/registry signature; for any other npm non-zero

    offline gate, and on all-green tag :latest.

    GOPROXY=off go build ./...), run per milestone with its B-source /testbed
    injected and `--network none` (+ `-e GOPROXY=off`). A real CLOSURE GAP (a UI
